# Simple config to deploy a Static SPA React App. 
# The most important field for deploying your React app is root where your build files will be hosted.
# For example, in this case, I copied my build file in the  /home/ubuntu/app-deploy/build directory.
# Since a React project is built of static files that only need a browser, you donâ€™t have to configure any further server-side language.
